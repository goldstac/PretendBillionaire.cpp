```cpp
// std::cout My Riches In C++ 💸
// Watch a C++ newbie pretend to be rich 😎

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int money = 5000;
    std::cout << "I Have $" << money << ":)\n"; // Output: I Have $5000:)

    // Why so many << ??
    // std::cout = console printer
    // << = send stuff to the printer
    // Chain as many as you want 😭

    int bigMoney = 1000000;
    std::cout << "I Have $" << bigMoney << " 💸 I'm basically a billionaire now!\n";

    // C++ makes me feel rich, but my wallet says otherwise 😅
}
